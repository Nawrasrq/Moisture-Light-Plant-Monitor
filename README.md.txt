Plant monitor project
- Measures the light and moisture levels during the day for optimal plant growth. 
- Blue LED lights up when moisture level drops below a threshold
- Yellow LED lights up when light level drops below wavelength of 500nm and 18 hours have passed
- Uses Arduino Uno R3, Grove moisture sensor, Grove light sensor, blue & yellow LED
